## A practice for me to iniatise a Git project locally

Firstly, I will git init a local git project and then create a readme file. 

Secondly, I will push this local git project to the remote Github.

Next step is to set up the communication between the local git and the remote Github.

In summary, each git project needs to be stored in a separate folder and the project name should match the folder created in the local working directory and the remote Github respository for us to set the communication. Now, they are talking, I can then pull all the changes made in the remote Github down to my local git and then push the changes made locally to the remote Github.
